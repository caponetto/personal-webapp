    "Since my freshman year of university (2007), I have been working with both back-end and front-end development. I am not attached to any specific programming language or technology, so I am more than happy as long as I am coding and learning.",
    "During my journey, I have had the opportunity to contribute to academic and professional projects, most of them related to Web, Windows, and Android. Conducting research, especially focusing on Machine Learning, is also something that I enjoy doing.",
    "My interests lie in the development of high-quality intelligent software using design patterns, optimized code guided by unit tests, machine learning, and agile methodologies. I take ownership of projects that I am involved with, I enjoy sharing my knowledge with others, and I have a passion for learning new things.",
