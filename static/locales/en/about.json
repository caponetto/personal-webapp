    "Hi there! My name is Guilherme Caponetto. I am currently working as a Principal Software Engineer at Red Hat, where I build tools for developers. I am a huge fan of the open-source community and I am always excited about building software that improves people's lives.",
    "Since my freshman year of university (2007), I have been working with both back-end and front-end development. I am not attached to any specific programming language or technology, so I am more than happy as long as I am coding and learning.",
    "During my journey, I have had the opportunity to contribute to academic and professional projects, most of them related to web, Windows, and Android. Conducting research, especially with a focus on machine learning, is also something that I enjoy doing.",
    "My interests lie in the development of high-quality intelligent software using design patterns, optimized code guided by unit tests, machine learning, and agile methodologies. I take ownership of projects I am involved in. I enjoy sharing my knowledge with others and have a passion for learning new things.",
    "Feel free to reach out to me on my social channels. I am always open to discussing new ideas and opportunities."
